# Baseball-PostgreSQL
This is a repository for PostgreSQL schemas and queries for baseball analytics.
The lahman folder contains the schema for the Lahman database, and the 
retrosheet folder contains the schema for a Retrosheet database. Both the lahman
and retrosheet folders have a folder called ```queries``` which obviously holds 
PostgreSQL queries using the respective databases.

Please feel free to submit a pull request to add to the repository and report
any issues or improvements that can be made to the code.
